#  The purpose of the "xyz2blh" function is to convert x, y and z cartesian coordinate inputs 
# to ellipsoid coordinates with iterative solution. The iterations are repeated until the change
# between two successive values of 𝜑("fi") is smaller than the precision of 10−12 in degrees.
# "fi" is here meaning to "latitude" and 10^-12 will be threshold value. We need them because 
# we solve repeatedly until the change between two value smaller than threshold. We do not know
# how many times will it repedeat so  here "while loop" will be useful. Some variables dependent
# to "fi" so should be they updated with the new value of 𝜑["fi"] at each iteration.

# Function inputs are:                                 Function output is:
    # x [cartesian coordinate system]                   # 𝜑 - ellipsoidal latitude
    # y [cartesian coordinate system]                   # 𝜆 - ellipsoidal longitude
    # z [cartesian coordinate system]                   # ℎ - ellipsoidal height

# The inputs of the functions are the P (target point) and R (topocenter) points whose coordinates are known in the global.
# Matrix multiplications are needed for operations, and thus angles are needed to rotate the axes. These angles are lambda 
# and fi angles, and these angles can be obtained with the xyz2blh function. The azimuth and zenith angles can be found from 
# the x, y and z coordinates of the ΔX′ coordinate matrix ([x,y,z]) obtained after matrix multiplications.
