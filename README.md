# GNSS Course Assignments and Projects

This repository contains the assignments and project work completed during my undergraduate studies within the scope of the **Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)** course.

The studies focus on fundamental GNSS positioning principles, satellite orbit determination, coordinate transformations, atmospheric delay modeling, and single point positioning (SPP) using GPS observations.

All implementations are developed in **Python**, following a modular structure. The repository includes solutions based on both **broadcast navigation messages** and **precise ephemeris (SP3)** data, as well as standard atmospheric correction models commonly used in GNSS processing.

## Topics Covered
- Satellite position computation using broadcast ephemeris (NAV)
- Satellite position computation using precise ephemeris (SP3)
- Lagrange interpolation for satellite orbit determination
- Earth rotation correction during signal propagation
- Coordinate transformations (ECEF ↔ Geodetic, local topocentric)
- Ionospheric delay modeling (Klobuchar)
- Tropospheric delay modeling (trop_SPP / Collins model)
- GPS code-based Single Point Positioning (SPP)
- Least Squares estimation of receiver coordinates and clock bias

## Repository Structure
Each assignment or project is organized in a separate folder under the main `GNSS` directory, following a clear and modular layout.
